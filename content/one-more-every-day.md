Every human is always looking to improve his or her life by establishing new habits, eating healthier, running every day, etc.
The only thing that matters in this situation is consistency.

It's easy to get lost in your own way by setting your goal too high. Instead, try to set your goal ridiculously low. Any progress at all is a good thing for developing your new habit and for your mental health. What is the smallest unit of progress possible?

- Run 1K
- Read one page
- Do one push up
- Take one photo

Just do it every day!

If you are consistent enough to do it every day for weeks or months, It's more progress than doing nothing. Soon enough, youâ€™ll have done more than you could have imagined.
